                <h3 class="section__sub-title">Context</h3>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Alexander Thomson, one of Glasgow’s greatest Victorian architects was
                    born in 1871. Throughout his
                    years, he has built many houses and did lectures which made him one of Glasgow’s foremost
                    well-respected architects. <br><br>

                    Thomson has developed his own personal Graeco-Egyptian style with
                    inspiration from architect and theorist, Owen Jones, who published “Grammar of Ornament”. <br><br>

                    Some of
                    Thomson’s designs were included for commercial warehouses, blocks of tenements, terraces of houses,
                    suburban villas, and churches. <br><br>

                    Because of his architectural style, he was given the nickname,
                    Alexander “Greek” Thomson. Despite his reputation, his works were little appreciated outside Glasgow
                    and in the 1950s, some of the buildings he built were torn down to rebuild new ones. <br><br>

                    In 1991, the
                    Alexander Thomson Society was created by a British historian, Dr Gavin Stamp, to preserve Thomson’s
                    works.</p>

                <h3 class="section__sub-title">Problem</h3>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Alexander Thomson’s works are still not as well-known to the public
                    despite him being one of the most
                    well-respected architects. <br><br>

                    The Mitchell Library currently holds some special materials that includes
                    some of Thomson’s original drawings within the collection. <br><br>These drawings were
                    professionally
                    photographed and converted into prints and digital formats (JPEG). <br><br>The team is tasked to
                    find a way
                    to showcase these valuable resources to the public, in particular to the public who are interested
                    in architecture, and make Thomson’s works more well-known to them.</p>

                                    Today was a productive day as we focused on perfecting our poster and sought
                                    valuable input to ensure its effectiveness in conveying our work to the audience.
                                    <br><br>
                                    It
                                    was enlightening to consult with others, as their perspectives offered fresh
                                    insights, enabling us to fine-tune the poster's message.<br><br>

                                    As the deadline inches closer, our attention has shifted to enhancing the website.
                                    We invested considerable effort into improving both its aesthetics and
                                    functionality, aiming to deliver a product that meets high standards. <br><br>
                                    The team's
                                    dedication was evident as we diligently combed through the website, leaving no room
                                    for any bugs or glitches.<br><br>

                                    However, a significant challenge we encountered was the loading speed of the site,
                                    mainly due to the large number of images stored.This issue left us
                                    pondering over
                                    potential solutions to ensure a seamless user experience while maintaining the
                                    visual richness of the site.<br><br>

                                    We received valuable feedback for our poster presentation, and we are eager to
                                    collaborate and make improvements together. We are pleased to hear that the
                                    top
                                    portion of our poster, including the header, problem statement, and solution, was
                                    well-received.<br><br>

                                    However, we recognize the need for refinement in the middle section. The reviewer
                                    suggested using larger images with headers for each image and adding a collection
                                    info page to showcase the Google Map and AR features.<br><br>

                                    We all agree that keeping the image descriptions concise with a single line of text
                                    for each feature is a great idea, as it will allow us to focus on visually conveying
                                    our project during the booth presentation.<br><br>

                                    We are glad that the bottom portion, featuring logos and QR codes, was positively
                                    noted. Moving forward, we are excited to work together and take advantage of the
                                    professor's availability for a second-round consultation tomorrow morning.<br><br>

                                    With just a few days left before the final submission, the pressure is mounting. We
                                    are determined to push through and deliver the project to the best of our abilities,
                                    meeting the high expectations we set for ourselves and those of our client.<br><br>

                                    Our collective motivation and commitment to excellence keep us going, and we remain
                                    hopeful that our hard work will yield a result that not only meets but exceeds our
                                    client's expectations.

                                <p>The project is coming to an end in a few days. However, the project still has some
                                    content to be filled in, and bugs to be fixed. Alongside the development related
                                    issues, the team has started on the design of the poster. <br><br>

                                    The team idea of the poster is to make it look sleek yet informative at the same
                                    time. Some research was done and discussion was held to finalise on the design of
                                    the poster. <br><br>

                                    After which, the content meant for the poster was then discussed. Our
                                    team end goal for the poster is for it to look minimalist yet contains enough
                                    information for viewers.

                                    This is a harder task as we had to
                                    feed information regarding the poster into the page. <br><br>Research has to be done
                                    and

                                    The team is working on refining the poster and determining whether the content is
                                    sufficient within the poster, as well as working on the static website with each
                                    member checking the contents of the website and providing feedback. <br><br>The team
                                    continued working on the website to polish the completed features. <br><br>

                                    Previously, the “Download Route” button in the “Virtual Tour” section of the website
                                    allowed users to download a GPX file. However, after some internal tests
                                    within the
                                    team, we found out that the users might not know what they can do with the GPX
                                    file.
                                    Hence, in the updated website, we added a tutorial for them to follow. <br><br>The
                                    tutorial
                                    teaches the user to import the GPX file into Google Maps, which the user can then
                                    use to view it on PC or on their mobile phones. <br><br>We also realized that it
                                    might be
                                    better for the user to choose between downloading the route as an image or as the
                                    GPX file. Thus, we implemented the radio buttons for the user to choose
                                    between the
                                    2 options. <br><br>

                                <p>Today, our team engaged in an insightful Exercise on Folding Instruction, which
                                    provided us with a wonderful opportunity to reflect on how we can enhance our
                                    instructional materials and the importance of a clear instruction. <br><br>
                                    Throughout the
                                    session, we delved into the principles of usability testing and discovered valuable
                                    insights that can lead us to create more user-friendly products.</p>

                                    alt="Dailies 1">
                                <br>
                                <p>The key takeaway was the significance of Clear Preparation. We learned the importance
                                    of having a well-defined plan and understanding the objectives and scope of
                                    usability testing. <br><br>By being clear about what we aim to achieve, we can
                                    ensure that
                                    our testing efforts yield meaningful and relevant results.<br><br>

                                    Another crucial aspect we explored was the idea of Moderation by Others. It was a
                                    valuable reminder that conducting usability testing by someone other than ourselves
                                    is vital. <br><br>This approach helps eliminate biases and ensures impartial
                                    evaluations,
                                    leading to more accurate observations. <br><br>This way, we can gain a fresh
                                    perspective on
                                    the user experience and identify areas for improvement that we might have overlooked
                                    otherwise.<br><br>

                                    The lesson also emphasized the significance of Comprehensive Analysis. We were made
                                    aware of how crucial it is to pay close attention to the analysis phase of usability
                                    testing. <br><br>The data and insights we gather during testing can reveal more
                                    significant
                                    findings than what we might initially expect. <br><br>Being attentive to the
                                    analysis stage
                                    allows us to uncover valuable opportunities for refining our prototype and making it
                                    more user-friendly.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    As the session came to a close, we were tasked with an exercise to create our own
                                    test for our prototype, applying the principles we learned today. <br><br>This
                                    hands-on
                                    experience was incredibly valuable, as it allowed us to put theory into practice and
                                    discover firsthand the effectiveness of a structured and well-planned usability
                                    testing approach. <br><br>

                                    Overall, the exercise and the insights gained today have left us feeling more
                                    equipped and confident in our ability to create products that truly meet the needs
                                    of our users. <br><br>By incorporating clear preparation, involving moderation by
                                    others,
                                    and conducting comprehensive analysis, we are well on our way to developing a more
                                    user-centric and successful end product.<br><br>

                                    Today, our development team made significant progress on refining the features for
                                    our project. We successfully implemented the Social Media scraping sections,
                                    allowing users to view the latest mentions related to their names on popular
                                    platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. <br><br>

                                    Additionally, we have been actively
                                    working on the Virtual tour section, and we expect it to be completed either by the
                                    end of this weekend or even as soon as today. The platform hosting is also underway,
                                    with a focus on GitHub Pages. <br><br>

                                    We're delighted to share that the Sharing and
                                    Commenting functionalities for posts are now up and running smoothly. Looking ahead,
                                    we plan to concentrate on further enhancing the features and optimizing the storage
                                    of collection images.

                                    <br><br> It has been a productive day, and we are excited about the
                                    continuous refinement and improvement of our project. <br>

                                    clients.<br><br>
                                    Web scraping was a feature mentioned in the discussion yesterday, which allows the
                                    website to have a more lively feel.
                                    The development team has performed web scraping from three different social media
                                    sites:<br><br>
                                    1. Facebook <br>
                                    2. Instagram <br>
                                    3. Twitter <br><br>
                                    Here is the current progress of this feature: <br><br>
                                    The development team has successfully implemented web scraping from the three

                                    For both scenarios, the aim is to pique the curiosity of users to learn more about

                                    their satisfaction, mentioning that we are on the right track.
                                    They particularly liked the features we have incorporated.<br><br>

                                    Our primary goal is to develop the website according to the clients' preferences, so

                                    After several discussions with the clients, we concluded that the following features
                                    would be added: <br><br>

                                    1. <b>Virtual Tour:</b> This feature aims to provide users with a guided tour of the
                                    buildings designed by Alexander Thomson. The purpose is to simplify the journey for
                                    users, eliminating the need for extensive planning. <br><br>

                                    2. <b>Thought (Comment) Section:</b> This proposed feature allows users to share
                                    their ideas or thoughts on each specific image. By incorporating this functionality,
                                    we encourage the community to engage, share ideas, and foster connections among
                                    users. <br><br>

                                    3. <b>Share Message:</b> Based on client feedback, we will implement a feature that
                                    allows users to include a message when sharing an image. This will streamline the
                                    process, enabling users to share both the image and their thoughts
                                    simultaneously.<br><br>

                                    4. <b>Social Media Scraping Page:</b> This feature will collect all posts with the
                                    hashtag #AlexanderThomson from social media platforms and display them in a separate
                                    tab. By incorporating this feature, we aim to keep the website dynamic and
                                    continuously updated with new posts from users worldwide.
                                    <br><br>

                                <p>
                                    Additionally, the team refined the pages within the website, to make it more
                                    aesthetically appealing to users.
                                    Some of the pages that have been refined include the contact page as well as the
                                    collection page.<br><br>
                                    The images of the buildings are being uploaded to the cloud hosting platform which
                                    will be called on our website.
                                    The team is also working on flooding information into the collection page for each
                                    image displayed. <br><br>
                                    After the meeting with the client, the team went to school today to gather feedback
                                    for our prototype from the professor. To sum it up, the following feedback were
                                    given:

                                    <br><br>
                                    1. Users might not know how to use the AR feature on the website.<br>
                                    2. People walking past the physical building and seeing the Hiro marker might not
                                    know what to do with it. <br>
                                    3. A visit us page to tell users to come visit the library.<br><br>

                                    With the 3 main given feedback, the team came up with solutions for each of them.
                                    <br><br>
                                    1. A tutorial page will be created to guide users on how to use the AR feature. <br>
                                    2. A QR code will be placed beside the Hiro marker for users to scan. The QR code
                                    will bring the user to the individual collections page on our website.<br>
                                    3. A visit us page will be created to tell the users to pay a visit to the library.
                                    <br><br>

                                    It was interesting to listen to the feedback given to our website. There were some
                                    points where the team missed out and the feedback would definitely help us in
                                    developing a better website.
                                    <br><br>

                                    The team has also decided not to implement the chatbot feature as we felt that the
                                    contact us page was
                                    sufficient to address any enquiries which the users might have. <br><br>

                                    Afterwards, the team also continued with the development of the website. Mainly
                                    focusing on integrating individual tasks that were assigned to each member
                                    previously, and the styling of the website.<br><br>
                                    The integration seems to be going smoothly, allowing us to showcase every single
                                    team member’s efforts, which we can’t wait to show everyone during the exhibition
                                    next week.

                                    The team has learnt how to use opposing models to crtically analsyse and evaluate
                                    the strengths and weaknesses
                                    of each model. <br><br>We also have different players to explore different
                                    perspectives
                                    preventing one model from being
                                    biased or incomplete.

                                <p>
                                    In class today, the team learnt more about Integrative Thinking and how to leverage
                                    the tension between 2 different models to create something new. <br><br>

                                    For today’s activity, we applied the Integrative Thinking concepts we learnt for the
                                    team’s project. From this activity, we broke down both models into the core
                                    elements, understanding the tensions and coming up with creative solutions that do
                                    not compromise.<br><br>

                                    One of the ideas we came up with is to have an offline app of the gallery such
                                    that both users with poor internet connectivity and users with mobility issues can
                                    experience the collection of Alexander Thomson more easily. <br><br>

                                    The team then decided to explore other buildings around Glasgow after our lesson,
                                    which includes 600-614 ellington street, Cecil street, Great Western, Sir Robert
                                    Peel Statue Plinth, Sixty Steps. Here are some of the photos the team took during
                                    our trip: <br><br>

                                <p>
                                    Apart from the trip to the different buildings, the team discussed some refinements
                                    that would be implemented to the website. <br><br>These refinements aim to enhance
                                    user
                                    experience while retaining the aesthetics of the website. We modified the iterations
                                    of the design through figma before developing them on the website.
                                    <br><br> The team came up with an idea for the AR feature which is to encourage
                                    users to physically head down to the building that Alexander Thomson designed to
                                    find out exclusive information. <br><br>
                                    The user will have to head down to the building to scan an AR marker to see the
                                    drawing of the building and the additional information that will only be seen in AR.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This allows users to learn more about the history of the building and garners
                                    attention towards Alexander Thomson’s works. While the user is there, they are also
                                    able to compare the drawing of the building to the physical building in AR.<br><br>
                                    In each individual collection popup, there will be a button to view the drawings in
                                    AR. A screenshot of the hi-fi prototype is shown below.
                                </p>

                                    Once the “View in AR” button is clicked, the camera will show up and the user will
                                    have to scan an AR marker which is a Hiro image as shown below.

                                    appear on
                                    the user’s phone camera along with the title of the building and exclusive
                                    information to encourage users to use this feature.<br><br>

                                    Hence, the team will be working on a proof of concept for this AR idea.<br><br>

                                    Additionally, the team had plans to implement a chatbot function in the website. The
                                    purpose of the chatbot is to enhance user experience whereby they can ask the
                                    chatbot questions and will be shown the answer. This reduces the time for users to
                                    search for a particular information, allowing them more time for other activities.

                                    Today, the team continued its dedicated work on the development of the website for
                                    our client. <br><br>We made substantial progress by refining various pages,
                                    including forms, the contact us button, and incorporating advanced features such as
                                    AR/VR and 3D works. <br><br>The integration of these features is coming along
                                    smoothly,
                                    and we are excited about the possibilities they offer.

                                    In pursuit of valuable inspiration and deeper insights into architectural design,
                                    our professor suggested visiting some prominent buildings in Glasgow, including the
                                    renowned Caledonia Road Church designed by Alexander Thomson. <br><br>Although we
                                    were
                                    unable to enter the church, we did have the opportunity to view it from the
                                    outside.<br><br>
                                    The grandeur and unique architectural elements of the Caledonia Road Church left a
                                    lasting impression on our team. <br><br>We captured reference images of the
                                    building, which
                                    will serve as a point of reference in our design process.
                                    <br><br>

                                    The experience of visiting the Caledonia Road Church and other buildings designed by
                                    Alexander Thomson has enhanced our understanding of his innovative style and
                                    approach to architecture. <br><br>These experiences will undoubtedly influence our
                                    design
                                    choices and ensure that your website receives a touch of extraordinary creativity.

                                    Today, the team has learnt various ways of prototyping to ideate the proposed
                                    solutions
                                    that we have come up with to resolve the problems identified previously. <br><br>
                                    For today’s activity, we did a presentation for the prototypes that we did so far.
                                    It was
                                    rather interesting to see how the other groups did their prototypes to conceptualize
                                    their
                                    ideas for their respective projects.

                                    For the initial prototype, the team did a role-play to simulate how various targeted
                                    audiences such as local history fans and art students will interact with Alexander
                                    Thomson’s works. <br><br>By putting ourselves in the audience’s shoes, we imagined
                                    how such
                                    users will feel and react upon seeing the works in such great detail.
                                    <br><br>Through this
                                    method,
                                    the team was able to gather data on how different prospective users will engage with
                                    his works
                                    and generated ideas. This role-playing was documented in the form of a storyboard.

                                    Diagrams prototyping method as our Lo-Fi prototype to draft out the rough layout of
                                    our website.<br><br>
                                    The website is a virtual gallery of Alexander Thomson’s works where users will be
                                    able to browse
                                    through and learn more about Alexander Thomson and his works. <br><br>We have added
                                    a new
                                    feature that
                                    allows the audience to view the corresponding real-life buildings (if still exists).

                                    The team then used figma to create a Digital Prototype for the Hi-Fi

                                    Through using figma,
                                    it serves as a platform to test our concepts and ideas before we start implementing
                                    the website. <br><br>It
                                    also allows the team to simulate the interaction between the prospective user and

                                    Today was another productive day for our team as we pressed on with our project
                                    tasks. The main focus of the day was preparing
                                    presentation slides and getting ready for the upcoming video submission, where we’ll
                                    showcase the remarkable progress
                                    we’ve made in this current week.

                                    The team visited the Mitchell Library to research on the artifacts by Alexander
                                    Thomson. <br><br>We met the client in the Stirling Room and we were presented with
                                    artifacts
                                    produced by Alexander Thomson himself, including two books that contained
                                    inspirations for his works. <br><br>We had a tour around the library and learned
                                    more about
                                    the library itself.<br><br>

                                    During the meeting, we discussed with the client if they have any design principles
                                    that the team should adhere to and were told that it was up to the team. <br><br>The
                                    client
                                    has also informed us that the website is to help them raise awareness of the
                                    artifacts by Alexander Thomson to the public, in particular to the people who are
                                    interested in architecture. <br><br>

                                    There are approximately 52 unique drawings in the
                                    collection. We will be receiving more information via email which will be sent to us
                                    later in the afternoon, where we can gather more information regarding the project.

                                    they want to ask the clients on Google Docs. <br><br>After 5 minutes, each member

                                    1 minute to select the top 10 questions. From the top 10 questions, the questions
                                    would be ranked from 1 to 10 based on the votes from the team members. <br><br>After
                                    conducting this practice, we realized that after the 3rd or 4th minute mark, we did

                                    instill a common understanding and goal among the team members.<br><br>
                                    Further project discussions were held after the meeting details were made known to
                                    us. This allowed the team to further strengthen our understanding of the
                                    project.<br><br>
                                    Communication channels and collaborative tools were created to facilitate
                                    collaborative work and ease of communication. Some of the platforms used include
                                    Dailies, Activities, Telegram, Google Drive.<br><br>
                                    Needfinding questions were raised from the previous meetings were collated. This is
                                    essential, as it allows the team to fill in any questions about the project that is
                                    not in the project brief and will be presented to the clients in the upcoming
                                    meeting.<br><br>
                                    We plan to sketch and collate some ideas for the solution after our need-findings
                                    from the client tomorrow. Afterwards, we will review and discuss the ideas and do up
                                    a brief proposal for consultation.<br><br>
                                    Our main priority of the meeting would be to get a clearer understanding of the
                                    project scope and ensure that we can get as much information as we can in order to
                                    propose the most suitable idea for the problem.

                                    importance. This is similar to a heritage trail where users
                                    can visit Alexander Thomson's iconic buildings while following a route. <br><br>
                                    Users will have access to an interactive map or navigation system, guiding them
                                    through the tour's route. The virtual tour will include
                                    information about each historic building, providing details about its significance,
                                    history and architectural features.

                                    1. Buildings can look very abstract and touristy but when looking into the building
                                    interior, there are certain flaws such as wasted space and useless hallways.

                                    2. Square and rectangular buildings may be basic and boring, but they tend to be
                                    places that
                                    people can feel comfortable in.

                                    fit without having to customize them etc. <br><br>All these should be taken into

                                    architects from the other abstract looking designs.

                                    5. Architects follow architectural plans of designs and spaces, sections, and use of
                                    spaces,
                                    elevation, and side views of the buildings. These plans always include standard
                                    scales that
                                    people can understand when showing drawings.

                                From this video, we can see how students in architecture school use these drawings
                                to study
                                about architecture when designing their own models. They mainly look at the space
                                constraints, materials, and how they can fully utilize the space such that they can
                                have a
                                proper interior before designing the exteriors.

                                <p>
                                    This is a video by a licensed architect from Canada who shared some important skills
                                    for
                                    Architecture that mainly focused on why sketches are important for architects. There
                                    are
                                    some interesting takeaways from this video to highlight:
                                </p>

                                        1. Sketching in general allows architects to focus on certain areas and give
                                        certain
                                        leeway
                                        to allow them to draw together with their bosses rather than rendering designs
                                        using
                                        computer software.
                                    </p>
                                </div><br>
                                <div class="feedback-box">
                                    <p class="feedback-content">
                                        2. Sketches and annotations such as materials, dimensions help architects save a
                                        lot
                                        of time
                                        to identify and organize strategies that can help them utilize spaces,
                                        especially
                                        complex
                                        spaces. <br><br>Many architects hence, still prefer sketching rather than
                                        computer
                                        software
                                        as they
                                        are a faster method to allow them to communicate their ideas to their
                                        stakeholders.
                                    </p>

                                        3. 3D modeling has its flaws despite its flexibility as if one is not familiar
                                        with
                                        the
                                        software, they can waste many hours because they just jump right in at designing
                                        without a
                                        solid idea.
                                    </p>
                                </div><br>
                                <div class="feedback-box">

                                        4. Sketches also help to generate better ideas because our cognitive ability
                                        functions quite
                                        differently when using hands. Sketches also allow us to add textures, use
                                        materials
                                        such as
                                        cups to draw shapes and colors which allow architects to add life to their
                                        drawings.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    From this video, we can tell that drawings are important because they help to convey
                                    the
                                    architect’s thought process, design thinking process that allows them to design
                                    their
                                    models. <br><br>By showcasing Thomson’s drawings with comparison to its
                                    corresponding
                                    real-life
                                    buildings, architects can better engage with Thomson’s works and understand why he
                                    has
                                    designed his buildings in a particular way to help the people which the building is
                                    providing services to. <br><br>For example, a hospital building providing medical
                                    services
                                    to the
                                    patients.

                                The team decided to use grids and spaces to organize the photographs like a catalogue
                                page
                                whereby users will view a list of images and when they click onto the images, they can
                                view
                                more information about the building and its drawings. <br><br>This was inspired by
                                Ikea's
                                catalogue
                                whereby when shoppers are shopping for furniture, they tend to look at the design of the
                                furniture first before looking at the annotations to view more about the item's
                                description.
                                <br><br>
                                This concept is very similar to a museum whereby people will look at the artwork and if
                                they
                                are interested to find out more about the artwork, they would look for the artwork's
                                description using annotations as well.

                                Here are some inspirations as to how we are going to display the image's information
                                after
                                the
                                users have clicked onto the image. It is similar to a museum experince whereby
                                one will
                                refer to the annotations on the artwork
                                and find the artwork description based on the annotations. <br><br>Above there is a Van
                                Gogh
                                Artpiece taken by one of our group members during
                                the Van Gogh Exhibition in Singapore for reference. Similary, the online gallery
                                website
                                allows users to click on a particular image
                                which will then display that image's description in a pop-up.

                                After meeting with the client, the team took some time to come up with some ideas as to
                                how we can engage our target audience when using the website.<br><br>
                                We have also received some feedback from our professor along the way, added some new
                                ideas to the board and rearrange them based on what is feasible
                                during this limited time period.
                                <br><br>
                                The image above shows our latest ideas categorised based on their feasibility during
                                this time period. Some interesting features to highlight include: <br><br>
                                1. Embedding <b>Google Map</b> of the actual buildings into the website <br>
                                2. Exploring the <b>use of AR</b> to showcase drawings and their corresponding buildings
                                <br>
                                3. <b>Social media engagment</b> to show awareness to more people via word of mouth
                            </p>

                            <h3>Storyboard</h3>
                            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/whathellahor/image/upload/v1690233722/3003-oip/Planning/storyboard.jpg"
                                alt="Storyboard">
                            <p>
                                The team proceed to try and put ourselves into the target audience's shoes based on the
                                prior research done and drafted a storyboard which helps us visualise
                                how our target audience will be using our website features. <br><br>In this storyboard,
                                our
                                target audience will be called 'Architects'
                                since we are targeting more towards the public with interest in architecture design.
                                <br><br>

                                The architects first proceeds to the Mitchell Library to find some inspiration for their
                                model design. <br><br>They come in to see a presentation
                                of Thomson's works but might have some questions or thoughts such as 'I hope there are
                                some actual pictures of the building that corresponds to the drawings'
                                to help them understand Thomson's architectural designs. <br><br>

                                This is where our website can come in handy as the architects can click onto the image
                                of their choice to learn more about it. Some information of the building
                                includes a short backstory of the building, image of the drawing and an embedded google
                                map view of the actual building if it exists. <br><br>

                                This could help the architects take more detailed notes on why Thomson designed his
                                buildings in such a way and use some of the techniques they learnt from
                                Thomson's works to apply in their own designs. <br><br>The architects can also share
                                their
                                discoveries on social media such as Instagram which allows Thomson's works
                                to be discovered to a wider range of audience, encouraging the community to check out
                                Thomson's works. <br><br>

                                There could be quizzes to make the architects learning of Thomson's works more fun and
                                impactful as they can better appreciate his works.

                                <h4>First Low-Fi Prototype</h4>
                                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/whathellahor/image/upload/v1690233721/3003-oip/Planning/low-fi_ver1.jpg"

                                <p>
                                    This was our first low-fi prototype before we had our first feedback from our
                                    professor. Initially, we thought of doing an informative website
                                    that is similar to wikipedia, with the function to search and filter the images
                                    based on what the audience is interested in.<br><br>

                                    How it works is that users can search for a specific building and the image will
                                    reflect in the search results. When the user clicks onto the image,
                                    it shows them a chunk of information on the building based on the drawing shown.
                                    There are also some filter buttons which allows them to filter the
                                    drawings based on the building characteristics such as hospital, church etc.
                                    <br><br>

                                    However, after some feedback, we have decided that this is not an ideal website as
                                    the purpose is to increase exposure of Thomson's works to the public
                                    and there is a high possibility that the public do not know much about his
                                    works.<br><br>
                                    Hence, it did not make sense to let the public search for the buildings
                                    when they do not know about Thomson's works. The filters also do not help much as
                                    there is not much visuals to engage the audience with just a website
                                    showcasing the images given to us. <br><br>

                                    Through this feedback session, we have decided to come together and discuss what
                                    does engaging audience mean to us and how we can refine the website such that
                                    it suits our users' needs. We have also taken the feedback to explore some of the
                                    buildings in Glasgow, hoping to encourage the users to visit the actual buildings.

                                    ideas based on their feasibility, we have decided to do a gallery portfolio
                                    website. <br><br>We have designed the website such that it is quite similar to
                                    visiting a
                                    museum where you get to view a collection of images and view the description
                                    based on the annotations. <br><br>

                                    In this case, users can click the image and a pop-up will appear which shows the
                                    image of the drawing, title and desciption and a button to export the information
                                    as a pdf file. <br><br>Users can also view a biography of Alexander Thomson which
                                    allows
                                    them to learn more about the designer himself instead of just looking at his
                                    works.<br><br>
                                    We have also included a contact us page so that users can submit their enquiries if
                                    they want to learn even more about Thomson or his works.

                                <p>The team proceed to design high-fi prototypes based on the low-fi prototypes which we
                                    previously designed. This helps us to better visualise of how our
                                    actual website is going to be like and assist us in developing the actual website.

                                    users to view the drawings and its corresponding building side by side. Users can
                                    also download the drawings so that they can use it for their own reference.

                                <p>After doing some research and testing, we have decided that the AR feature is
                                    feasible and decided to incooperate it into our website.<br><br>

                                    The concept behind this feature is to encourage users to visit the actual buildings
                                    and when they are at the location, they can click on the 'View in AR'
                                    button which enables access to their mobile phone cameras. More will be discussed in
                                    our Interacting with Our Audience section below.

                                <p>After our second client meeting on 26 July, the client suggested us to include
                                    features such as a virtual tour (similar to a heritage trail),
                                    social media feed and thoughts section. <br><br>The team proceeded to plan and add

                                    features to enhance our user engagement. The images above

                                <p>Users are able to use the Google Map features such as the
                                    360 street view and any additional pictures of the actual building
                                    if the buildings still exist in Glasgow. <br><br>With the 360 street view and
                                    location in

                                    Map, it encourages the public to go and visit the buildings on their own. <br>

                                <p>For this feature, there can be a preset marker tag, which in this case we are using
                                    Hiro
                                    preset, that can
                                    be attached to the building. <br><br>This Hiro tag can be a piece of paper that is
                                    stuck on
                                    some
                                    parts of the building.<br><br>
                                    After users click on the 'View in AR' button on our website, they will enable our
                                    website to access their mobile phone cameras.<br><br>
                                    Users can use their mobile phone camera and scan this Hiro tag which displays the
                                    drawing that is corresponding to the building they are viewing. <br><br>

                                    feature to our website - a virtual tour resembling a heritage trail.
                                    <br><br>

                                    This feature showcases the locations of some of Alexander Thomson's iconic
                                    buildings that still exist in Glasgow. Users can explore these routes and pinpoint
                                    the buildings,
                                    providing them with a convenient summary of their locations. <br><br>

                                    The virtual tour aims to encourage users to visit these historical buildings and
                                    discover their architectural beauty firsthand. <br><br>

                                    be included in our individual collections page whereby users can share the images
                                    and write some of their thoughts
                                    about what they have discovered today. <br><br> This increases awareness to a larger
                                    audience and with the ability to tag locations,
                                    it sends a message to encourage more people to visit the buildings.<br><br>

                                The team presented to the client with some features of the website which we have
                                developed during the first development phase.
                                Some highlighted features of the website include: <br><br>
                                1. Text to speech collection description <br>
                                2. Share to social media feature <br>
                                3. Embedded Goggle Map feature of the specific building <br>
                                4. Explained the AR feature concept to encourage the public to viist the buildings
                                <br><br>
                                The team proceeds to ask the client on their opinions of the current features and what
                                other features they would like us to include
                                to improve user engagement with Thomson's works.

                            <p>
                                The client really liked the idea of having the Google Map feature and the AR feature to
                                encourage users to visit the buildings in Glasgow.<br><br>
                                They also liked the sharing to social media feature as it helps to share the word around
                                about the buildings and spreads greater awareness
                                to interest others to visit the place themselves. <br><br>For example, when the user
                                shares and
                                tags the location of the building, it encourages
                                the people viewing that user's post to head down to the location and check out the
                                buildings on their own.

                                    1. Having a platform to allow users to comment their thoughts to help the library
                                    moderate the user's interest <br><br>
                                    <b>Answer:</b> The team proposed adding a thoughts section on the individual

                                    of Thomson's iconic buildings that still exists in Glasgow. Users should
                                    be able to indicate their interest on the tours hosted by the library. <br><br>
                                    <b>Answer:</b> The team decided to include another tab called 'Virtual Tours' and
                                    will
                                    be doing

                                    given by the client on how we can conduct a Alexander Thomson virtual tour to
                                    showcase
                                    his works around Glasgow. <br><br>

                                    discover Thomson's works through our website. <br><br>
                                    <b>Answer:</b> The team has proposed using unique hashtags and display posts that
                                    included
                                    these hashtags on our website so that more people are more intrigued to

                                The team also decided to consult our professor for additional feedback for the current
                                existing features we have. <br><br>For this presentation,
                                we presented using our Figma prototype to better illustrate how the features work.

                                Professor mentioned that our features are good enough as of now, but he has a few
                                concerns as to <b>whether users know how to use the AR feature</b> and
                                <b>how could we make our website stand out more.</b><br><br> Some of his suggestion
                                include: <br><br>

                                1. A <b>QR code</b> will be pasted along side the Hiro image so that people are able to
                                <b>visit
                                    our website</b> and be guided on how to use the AR feature. <br>
                                2. <b>Exclusive information can only be seen in AR</b> to encourage people to head down
                                to
                                physical building.

                                    The team decided to use the Sketches and Drawing prototyping method to visualize the
                                    layout of our interactive website and where each feature will be placed at, helping
                                    us
                                    to validate if the ideas we came up with were feasible and allowed us to make
                                    changes if
                                    necessary more easily.<br><br>

                                    The team did a comparison between different layouts for the prototype and the team
                                    made
                                    a decision to reject the layout that is less user friendly and proceeded on to make
                                    an
                                    improved prototype using figma.

                                    The team went on a mini excursion to visit prominent buildings in Glasgow to gain
                                    inspiration and deeper insights into architectural design. <br><br>One such

                                    we had the privilege of viewing was the Caledonia Road Church, an architectural

                                    From the client, it was mentioned that the team is progressing well and in the right
                                    direction, and liked our features. The team then followed up by asking if there are

                                    features the client would like in the website, and they responded by naming a few.

                                    us to create more user-friendly products. In one of the activities, we made written
                                    instructions on how to fold a paper airplane, which purpose is to provide clear
                                    instructions for users to create a task.<br><br>

                                    From this activity, we understood the significance of Clear Preparation and learned
                                    the
                                    importance of having a well-defined plan and understanding the objectives and scope
                                    of
                                    usability testing. By being clear about what we aim to achieve, we can ensure that
                                    our
                                    testing efforts yield meaningful and relevant results.<br><br>

                                    We also explored the idea of getting someone from outside the team to conduct
                                    usability
                                    testing (Moderation by Others). This approach helps eliminate biases and ensures
                                    impartial evaluations, leading to more accurate observations.<br><br>

                                    As such, we will be getting users from other team to test our website and give us
                                    feedback. Apart from that, the team also learnt the importance of paying close
                                    attention
                                    to the analysis phase of usability testing. <br><br>The data and insights we gather
                                    during
                                    testing can reveal more significant findings than what we might initially expect.
                                    Being
                                    attentive to the analysis stage allows us to uncover valuable opportunities for
                                    refining
                                    our prototype and making it more user-friendly.<br><br>

                                    The team will be refining the product as much as possible to ensure that the final
                                    product is as polished as it can be.

                                    During the client meeting held on 26th July 2023, the team initially felt
                                    disheartened when the other team presented their solution, which incorporated
                                    numerous robust technical functionalities. <br><br>

                                    However, things took a positive turn when
                                    we presented our proposed website to the client. They showed great interest and
                                    enthusiasm, attentively listening to our proposal and even complimenting some of the
                                    features for their usefulness. <br><br>

                                    Moreover, the client provided us with valuable feedback and resources to enhance
                                    user engagement, expressing their liking for the idea and direction we aimed to take
                                    in order to engage their target audience.<br><br>

                                    This encouraging response significantly boosted our morale and confidence, as we
                                    realized that our efforts had met the client's expectations. We were truly grateful
                                    for this moment, which taught us the importance of confidence in our hard work, even
                                    if we may lack certain capabilities that the other team possesses.

                                <p>Initially, the team had hesitations about implementing this particular feature as it
                                    appeared highly challenging, considering our existing capabilities. Nevertheless, we
                                    were
                                    encouraged by positive feedback from both our client and professors, we were
                                    resolute in our determination to make it work and not let them down. <br><br>

                                    To tackle this ambitious task, the team collaborated in gathering research on AR
                                    features and assembled a group of members with strong technical expertise to lead
                                    the development process. <br><br>

                                    With concerted efforts, we eventually succeeded in getting the feature up and
                                    running, bringing us immense satisfaction to witness its successful implementation.

                                    capabilities. <br><br>The process was challenging, as we encountered numerous trials

                                    errors while seeking the best way to implement the feature. Our main goal was to not
